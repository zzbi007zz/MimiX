# X Content Strategy

What to share, when to skip, and how to build audience through valuable content.

## Core Philosophy

**Volume + Value = Growth**

Post consistently (3+ times daily) with genuinely valuable content. Not everything performs—even great insights flop due to writing or algorithm. Success comes from consistency and helping people solve real problems.

**Goal:** Build audience that respects your ideas. When people stop scrolling because they recognize your name, you've won.

## Three Pillars of Effective Content

Every post needs all three. Miss one and it likely flops.

### 1. Genuinely Valuable

**Fresh insights from real experience**, not recycled advice said a thousand times.

- Pull from your actual work and discoveries
- Share what surprised you or changed your approach
- Contradict common assumptions with specifics
- Help people skip mistakes you made

**Test:** Would I bookmark this if someone else wrote it?

**Good:** "Agent discovery is fundamentally different from app discovery. Apps are static—you search features. Agents are conversations."

**Bad:** "Discovery is important for products"

### 2. Immediately Actionable

**Give people a system they can implement today.**

Pure observation gets views. Teaching implementation gets followers and business.

- Don't just point at something, show how to use it
- Walk through the actual process
- Make it immediately applicable

**Good:** "How to write copy that sounds human with GPT-4.5: [step-by-step process]"

**Bad:** "The new ChatGPT update is incredible"

### 3. Sparks Natural Engagement

**Never beg for engagement.** Structure content so bookmarks and replies happen organically.

**Trigger bookmarks with hooks that signal value:**

- "How to [solve problem]"
- "Here's what I learned [doing X]"
- "Do this before [common action]"

**Drive replies with:**

- **Strong opinion**: Specific, controversial claim people argue or support
- **Collaborative invitation**: Leave room for others to share approach

## Content Selection Framework

### Always Share ✓

| Type                             | What to Include                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shipped work + learnings**     | What you built (specific), one key insight, why it matters                   |
| **Non-obvious insights**         | What surprised you, why it contradicts expectations, how it changes approach |
| **Tool recommendations**         | What it does, specific benefit (numbers), real example from your use         |
| **Solutions to common problems** | The problem, why obvious solutions failed, what actually worked              |
| **Counter-intuitive patterns**   | The observation, why unexpected, practical implications                      |

### Consider (Medium Priority)

- **Industry takes with unique angle** — Your specific perspective from real work
- **Process improvements** — Must include concrete examples and outcomes
- **Technical decisions** — Share context and reasoning
- **Genuine questions** — Ask about specific approaches, not vague "thoughts?"

### Skip ✗

**Low Priority:**

- Progress updates without insights
- Plans before execution (share when shipped)
- Obvious observations
- Feelings about work without value
- Meta-posting about posting

**Never Share:**

- Engagement bait ("RT if you agree")
- Generic motivation ("Never give up!")
- Vague hype without specifics
- Complaints without solutions
- Announcements of announcements

**Red flags in notes (usually skip):**

- "Just wanted to share..."
- "Random thought..."
- "Does anyone else..."
- "Feeling grateful..."

## Content Mix (Weekly Target)

Over 21 posts per week:

- **8 posts (38%):** Educational/How-to
- **6 posts (29%):** Personal updates (what you shipped)
- **4 posts (19%):** Insights/observations
- **3 posts (14%):** Questions/engagement

Don't optimize daily. Post valuable content, mix balances naturally.

## Recognizable Style Development

Generic content blends together. Distinctive style makes people stop scrolling.

**Develop 3-4 structural patterns that feel natural:**

- Specific opening phrases
- Consistent formatting (like using ">" for lists)
- Particular ways you emphasize points
- Phrases you use before certain types of takes

**Consistency without formula.** Patterns should be recognizable but not templated.

Examples:

- Always using ">" to break down processes
- Starting tool recs with "X handles Y automatically"
- Using "tbh" or "honestly" before controversial takes
- Writing in fragments for emphasis

## Pre-Post Checklist

**Value:**

- [ ] Teaches something specific
- [ ] Saves time or helps avoid mistakes
- [ ] From genuine experience
- [ ] Would I bookmark this?

**Specificity:**

- [ ] Names tools, projects, or numbers
- [ ] Includes concrete examples
- [ ] Avoids vague adjectives

**Actionability:**

- [ ] Can someone implement today?
- [ ] Shares HOW, not just WHAT

**Clarity:**

- [ ] One clear idea
- [ ] Hook in first line
- [ ] Every word earns its place

**Engagement:**

- [ ] Invites response naturally
- [ ] Specific enough to discuss

## The Outcome

Consistent high-value posting builds:

- Audience that respects ideas, not just follower count
- People who stop scrolling when they see your name
- Trust through demonstrated expertise
- Natural conversion when selling (they've experienced your teaching)

**Final test:** "Would I want to read this if someone else posted it?"

If yes → share. If no → back to notes.
